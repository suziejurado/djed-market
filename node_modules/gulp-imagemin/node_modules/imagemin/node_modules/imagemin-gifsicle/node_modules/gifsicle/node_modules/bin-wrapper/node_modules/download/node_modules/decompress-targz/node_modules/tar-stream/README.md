# tar-stream

tar-stream is a streaming tar parser and generator and nothing else. It is streams2 and operates purely using streams which means you can easily extract/parse tarballs without ever hitting the file system.

```
npm install tar-stream
```

## Usage

tar-stream exposes two streams, [pack](https://github.com/mafintosh/tar-stream#packing) which creates tarballs and [extract](https://github.com/mafintosh/tar-stream#extracting) which extracts tarballs. To [modify an existing tarball](https://github.com/mafintosh/tar-stream#modifying-existing-tarballs) use both.


It implementes USTAR with additional support for pax extended headers. It should be compatible with all popular tar distributions out there (gnutar, bsdtar etc)

If you want to pack/unpack directories on the file system check out [tar-fs](https://github.com/mafintosh/tar-fs) which provides file system bindings to this module.

## Packing

To create a pack stream use `tar.pack()` and call `pack.entry(header, [callback])` to add tar entries.

``` js
var tar = require('tar-stream')
var pack = tar.pack() // pack is a streams2 stream

// add a file called my-test.txt with the content "Hello World!"
pack.entry({ name: 'my-test.txt' }, 'Hello World!')

// add a file called my-stream-test.txt from a stream
var entry = pack.entry({ name: 'my-stream-test.txt', size: 11 }, function(err) {
  // the stream was added
  // no more entries
  pack.finalize()
})

entry.write('hello')
entry.write(' ')
entry.write('world')
entry.end()

// pipe the pack stream somewhere
pack.pipe(process.stdout)
```

## Extracting

To extract a stream use `tar.extract()` and listen for `extract.on('entry', header, stream, callback)`

``` js
var extract = tar.extract()

extract.on('entry', function(header, stream, callback) {
  // header is the tar header
  // stream is the content body (might be an empty stream)
  // call next when you are done with this entry

  stream.on('end', function() {
    callback() // ready for next entry
  })

  stream.resume() // just auto drain the stream
})

extract.on('finish', function() {
  // all entries read
})

pack.pipe(extract)
```

## Headers

The header object using in `entry` should contain the following properties.
Most of these values can be found by stat'ing a file.

``` js
{
  name: 'path/to/this/entry.txt',
  size: 1314,        // entry size. defaults to 0
  mode: 0644,        // entry mode. defaults to to 0755 fo
